My first Mac OS X Dashboard widget:  display the number of turns outstanding for an RSW game.  http://rswgame.com

This number is interesting for two reasons:
  1) The lower the number gets, the closer we are to the next turn.
  2) If the number is "1" and I haven't submitted my orders yet, it means everyone is waiting on me.  The turn will run on the due date anyway, but I like this subtle nudge to get things done.
